<br>
<p> Ddos is one way for attacking to servers . In this way, hackers use some tools for sending a lot of packets for down the server and websites. Ddos means attacking to one server with a lot of people but, dos means attacking to server by one person. I advice that Ddos attack is better than dos for big websites.<p>
